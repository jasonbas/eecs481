#I created a simple Rock Paper Scissors game app from scratch for the Android environment.  There are three clickable buttons.  In main activity, the necessary logic will be executed based upon the button click.  The first click is for player one and the second is for player two.  After two clicks the winner is announced.  I also modified the background color to teal by modifying activity_main.xml and strings.xml.

#Directions:
#Clone the git repository from https://github.com/jasonbas/eecs481.git.  The source code is contained in RockPaperScissors.zip.  Unzip file.  Import the unzipped file into eclipse using File > Import > Existing Android Code Into Workspace.  Compile code.
